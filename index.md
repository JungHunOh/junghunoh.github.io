## [CV](cv.pdf)

**Ph.D candidate** \
**Affiliation**: Department of ECE, Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea \
**Email**: dh6dh@snu.ac.kr \
**Google scholar**: [profile](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=fCFkL9EAAAAJ&hl=ko)

I am a Ph.D candidate student majoring in computer vision at SNU computer vision lab, advised by [Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/kmlee/).


## **Research Interests**

My current research topic is representation learning, especially for generalization to unseen data distribution.
More specifically, I am working on developing representation learning methods for **few-shot incremental learning** and **out-of-distribution generalization and detection**.
My research topics also include **network pruning and quantization** for efficient neural networks and **image super-resolution**.
